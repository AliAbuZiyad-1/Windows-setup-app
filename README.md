# This is Windows Setup app my first application, its actually terribly bad but i want your guys opinion on it, you can run this anywhere, in windows pe in a live windows enviroment (only supports windows (i dont think my app has linux wine combatibily since its made from Visual Studio but whatever))

Tbh the only thing this app can do is:
- Fix my pc (which litterly only runs command prompt and doesnt work if you dont have it in system, so that not gonna work)
- Select image file and edition (like normal)
- But this is the worst part (The partitioning) first of all you can only pick a volume, and if that volume doesnt have a letter, well cant use that (unless you use that fix my pc button and use diskpart but whatever) and litterly nothing else, no formatting image, no creating partition, just pick a partition and select it
- Then the last part the installing phase, as you can see ots just installing there is the logs which is kinda pointless but good for debugging if any physcopaths want to help me with my abomination

## If you tried my app, its actually bad but let me know how i did on my first ever app with almost no knowledge about C# which takes way to long to troubleshoot and stuff but hey probably won't use it
